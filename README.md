# NavigationGraph7Net7 net7.0-android33

**14/03/2023** 

Removed the NavActivityOnBackPressedCallback class as it was serving no purpose and therefore not required.

Also commented out code in the HomeFragment re NavFragmentOnBackPressedCallback as it is no longer used. Therefore also commented out the reference to the home fragment in NavFragmentOnBackPressedCallback's HandleBackPressed.

NavigationGraph7Net also supports the Predictive Back Gesture by default. For more detailed information re the Predictive Back Gesture, please see the project PredictiveBackGestureNet7.

Now that VS 2022 17.6.0 Prev 1.0 has a half decent markdown editor, the NavigationGraph.docx file used by previous projects has been discontinued and replaced with the github READMe.md.
